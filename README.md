# BeautySalon-ServletAPI
The system implements the work schedule of beauty salon employees. There are roles: Guest, Client, Administrator, Hairdresser.
The guest can see the catalog of services and the list of hairdressers taking into account sorting:
- by the name;
- by rating
can filter:
- by certain hairdresser;
- by services.
The client (authorized user) can sign up for a specific service provided by the hairdresser and for a specific time slot.
The administrator can:
- view customer orders and change the selected time slot;
- cancel order;
- accept payment for the service.
The hairdresser sees his schedule (busy and free time slots) and marks the execution of the order.
After providing services, the Client leaves feedback. The offer to leave feedback comes to the Client's e-mail the day after the service is provided.
